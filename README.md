# libre-wc
a demo repository for Code4Lib 'Multisite Man(i)agement' workshop

## Background

This repository was made for a 3-hour workshop presented at Code4Lib 2020. It is not (yet?)
  a functioning repository that's meant to exemplify the full breadth or best practice for 
  how you'd want to set this up. For now, see [bulib/bulib-wc](https://github.com/bulib/bulib-wc),
  for a better example of this happening for real at a library, at some bit of scale.

## Description/Introduction

This is a very lightweight repository built to demonstrate as simply as possible
  some of the concepts and tools we're working with and demonstrate how they're used 
  without any magic going on. 
  
It's very much of a skeleton right now, that we'll (hopefully) fill in during (and just after) 
  the workshop so you'll be able to see the steps of building it up from very little.
