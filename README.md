# libre-wc
a demo repository for Code4Lib 'Multisite Man(i)agement' workshop (slides available at [osf (PDF)](https://osf.io/s9kx5/) and [google sheets](https://tinyurl.com/c4l-workshop-multisite-all))

## Background

This repository was made for a [3-hour workshop](https://2020.code4lib.org/workshops/MultiSite-Mania-A-Modular-Strategy-for-Creating-and-Maintaining-Consistency-Across-Platforms) 
  presented at [Code4Lib 2020](https://2020.code4lib.org/). 
  
It is _not_ a functioning boilerplate meant to exemplify the full breadth or best practice for 
  how you'd want to set this up in production. See [open-wc](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc) for that.
  
For an example of something like this being used in real life, see [bulib/bulib-wc](https://github.com/bulib/bulib-wc).
  We're using web components there at a real library, at some bit of [scale](https://bulib.github.io/bulib-wc/), 
  across a number of platforms.

## Description/Introduction

This is a very lightweight repository built to demonstrate _as simply as possible_
  some of the concepts and tools we're working with and demonstrate how they're used 
  without any "magic". 
  
It's very much of a _skeleton_ right now, that we'll (hopefully) fill in during (and just after) 
  the workshop so you'll be able to see the steps of building it up from very little.
